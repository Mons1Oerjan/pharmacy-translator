# pharmacy-translator
A big issue in today's pharmaceutical software industry is communication with immigrants. 
Patients sometimes do not understand the prescription / correct amount of medicine dosages to take. 
Pharmacists have also reported that google translate often do not convey the right message. Therefore,
we came up with a system that prints the prescription / dosage in the patient's preferred language in hopes to
solve this issue. For example, the code "T 1 P 1D", which in English means 'take one pill daily', would be 
translated into Spanish for a patient that prefers Spanish. 

This is a Java Spring web app (prototype) that translates prescription codes into the patients' preferred language.

Technologies used:
- Code: Java with the framework Spring
- DB: JPA / Hibernate with mySQL
- FrontEnd: Bootstrap
